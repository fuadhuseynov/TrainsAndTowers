Trains And Towers - Fuad Huseynov.

The application accepts a .txt file's full path as a command line argument.
The format of the text file must be as following:

AB5  
BC4  
CD8  
DC8  
DE6  
AD5  
CE2  
EB3  
AE7  

If the file format is wrong, the application will exit with error "WRONG FILE FORMAT".
There is a sample "input.txt" file in the repository that could be used for testing.
